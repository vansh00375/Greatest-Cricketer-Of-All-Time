                <p>In the midst of all the constant adulation he has received over a significantly transitional period for cricket, 
                    commercially and otherwise, and in a sea of statistics that every Tendulkar-centric conversation attracts, it is sometimes easy to forget that he 
                    was perhaps the most complete batsman of his generation - one who combined natural talent with hard work and dedication; one who recognized the
                     importance of shaping and polishing the diamond. This uncommon blend of dedication and ability made him stand out in the crowd, and made him the
                      legend that is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar.</p>

                <p>Tendulkar has been the single biggest factor behind the explosion of popularity that cricket enjoys in India which led to the 
                    Indian board becoming the richest and most powerful in world cricket. In a country already predisposed to cricket, Tendulkar gave the people a hero 
                    they could look upto regardless of age, colour, creed or sect - and catapulted cricket from a sport to a religion in the subcontinent.</p>
