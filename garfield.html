                <p>Sir Garfield Sobers, in full Sir Garfield St. Aubrun Sobers, byname Gary Sobers, (born July 28, 1936, Bridgetown,
                     Barbados), West Indian cricketer, considered by many authorities the most gifted all-around player of all time.
                      As a batsman, he established a record for Test (international) matches by scoring 365 runs, not out, in a 
                      single innings (West Indies versus Pakistan, 1957–58 season), a record that stood until 1994. He was an 
                      exceptional bowler who could bowl in every conceivable style, from medium pace to left arm spin. He was also a 
                      brilliant fielder at any position but particluarly adept in close-to-the-wicket fielding.</p>

                <p>Sobers was educated at Bay St. School, Barbados, and became a left-hand batsman and a left-hand bowler in cricket.
                     He entered first-class cricket at age 16 and bowled for the West Indies team against England during the 1953–54
                      season. His team defeated Australia and then, in 1966, beat England three matches to one. His Test career 
                      lasted 20 years, and he captained the West Indies 39 times. He also captained the Nottinghamshire English 
                      county team (1968–74).</p>

                <p>He retired in 1974 and was knighted in 1975. His batting 8,032 runs in Test matches (1953–74) set a record, as 
                    did his 26 centuries (100 runs in a single innings). He was named one of Wisden’s five cricketers of the century
                     in 2000. Sobers wrote several books on cricket, including a novel, Bonaventure and the Flashing Blade (1967), 
                     and, with J.S. Barker, a history of cricket in the West Indies (1967).</p>
