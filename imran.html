                <p>In the league of extraordinary gentlemen with remarkable achievements beyond the cricketing realm, Imran Khan 
                  would rank among the topmost in the modern era. It all started with the long locks, charming good looks, an 
                  energetic gallop to the crease, a gazelleâ€™s leap, and a projectile swerving around the clueless bat, headed 
                  inevitably towards the base of the stumps. 26 years before his orotund, plummy voice and his way with words
                   made him the prime minister of his country, he picked up the microphone in Melbourne, 10,000km from his homeland,
                  and delivered a rousing speech at the culmination of perhaps the greatest fairy tale in the history of cricket.</p>
