                <p>Sir Ian Botham, the legendary all-rounder in cricket, defied the notion of impossibility on July 20, leaving a 
                    lasting legacy until his retirement. His journey to greatness began in 1974 when, playing for Somerset, he
                     fearlessly continued batting after being hit in the mouth by the West Indian fast bowler Andy Roberts. Botham's
                      impact was immediate when he made his Test debut against Australia in 1977, taking 5/74. He displayed 
                      consistent excellence, including two centuries against Pakistan in 1978 and a memorable performance at Lord's 
                      where he scored a hundred and claimed 8/34 in the second innings. Despite a challenging captaincy stint, 
                      Botham achieved another remarkable feat by becoming the first player to score a century and pick up 10 wickets 
                      in a Test against India at the Wankhede. The Ashes series in 1981 witnessed Botham's remarkable comeback, as 
                      he played a pivotal role in England's historic victories, showcasing his prowess with both bat and ball. 
                      In his illustrious career, Botham accumulated remarkable statistics, earning him a knighthood and a place in 
                      the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Today, he is a respected cricket commentator, providing insights during England's
                       matches and major tournaments globally. </p>
